### Something's broken?
Please do open a new issue, but please check first that the TODO list and same issue has not already been raised and that you are using the latest version :)

Please **do not** send private emails - Github Issues are supposed to help whoever might have your same issue, so it is the right place to help each other.

Issues not filled out with the provided templates are going to be closed. Please provide as much information as possible: do include a plunkr so that I can see what the problem is without having to replicate your environment on my laptop. 

No features requests will be considered, unless they are Pull Requests. I feel the component is already quite bloated, and I'd like on solving bugs and making this more reliable for everyone.

## Contributing/Pull Requests
Contributions are highly welcome! No, there is no guideline on how to do it. Just make sure to lint and unit test your changes. We'll figure out the rest with a couple of messages...
